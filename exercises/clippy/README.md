### Clippy

The Clippy tool is a collection of lints to analyze your code so you can catch common mistakes and improve your Rust code.

If you used the installation script for Rustlings, Clippy should be already installed.
If not you can install it manually via `rustup component add clippy`.

For more information about Clippy lints, please see [their documentation page](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/).
